## 🎬 Slide 1 — Title Slide *(15 sec, Presenter 1 opens)*

- **Title:** Predicting Student Dropout in Online Courses: An Early-Warning System
- Team names, DATA 6545, Spring 2026
- One-line hook: *"Catching at-risk students by Day 30 — while there's still time to help."*

## 🎯 PART 1 — THE PROBLEM & THE DATA *(Presenter 1 — ~3 min, slides 2–5)*

### Slide 2 — Why This Matters *(45 sec)*

- Online courses have chronic high withdrawal rates (~31% in our dataset)
- Every dropout = lost revenue + lost learning outcome + wasted outreach dollars
- **The core idea:** if we can flag at-risk students *early*, interventions (tutoring, check-ins, reminders) can actually work
- Stakeholders: platform admins & student support teams

### Slide 3 — The Business Question *(30 sec)*

- One framed question: *"Using only the first 30 days of course data, can we predict who will withdraw — early enough to intervene?"*
- Why Day 30? Sweet spot between enough behavioral signal and enough runway to act
- Primary metric: **Recall** (missing an at-risk student is the costly error)

### Slide 4 — The Data: OULAD *(45 sec)*

- Open University Learning Analytics Dataset
- **32,593 student-course enrollments** across 4 tables
- Demographics + registration + VLE clickstream (10.6M records) + assessments (174K records)
- Filtered to only what's visible by Day 30 → 2.98M click events, 26.5K submissions
